# Multilayer Perceptron with C++ from Scratch

This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch in C++. The MLP achieves 97%+ accuracy on the MNIST dataset after 80 epochs.

## Implementations

The MLP is implemented using three different libraries:
- Eigen
- OpenBlas
- cuBlas

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 97%+ on MNIST after 80 epochs

## Usage

Run the VS2022 project. No additional dependencies.
